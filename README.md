# Turbofan RUL Prediction (NASA C-MAPSS)

## Overview
This repository presents a deep learning framework for predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan engines using the **NASA C-MAPSS dataset**.  
A hybrid **CNN–BiLSTM–Attention model** has been implemented to capture both local degradation patterns and long-term temporal dependencies.  

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning methods to predictive maintenance in aerospace systems.

## Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Wavelet-based denoising to smooth noisy sensor signals.  
- Extraction of rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) and delta features.  
- Implementation of piecewise-linear RUL labeling capped at 125 cycles.  

### 2. Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture
- Convolutional layers capture local degradation patterns across multiple time scales.  
- Bidirectional LSTM layers model long-term temporal dependencies.  
- Dual attention mechanisms highlight critical sensors and time steps.  
- Composite loss function (MSE + Huber) balances robustness and accuracy.  

### 3. Training and Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna across multiple dataset subsets.  
- Early stopping and checkpointing strategies to mitigate overfitting.  
- Modular training pipeline designed for reproducibility.  

### 4. Evaluation and Visualization
- Performance metrics include RMSE, MAE, and R².  
- Visualizations of predicted versus actual RUL trajectories.  
- Residual error distributions and attention weight plots.
